## Pipe

It is a data structure, which is used to communicate between processes. The Pipe() function returns a pair of connection objects connected by a pipe which by default is duplex(two way)[1].

- It returns a pair of connection objects that represent the two ends of pipe.
- Every object has two methods â€“ send() and recv(), to communicate between processes[1].

### Points to note:
- **Pipe can have only 2 endpoints whereas a Queue can have multiple producers and conumers.**
- A Queue can be used when there are multiple processes communicating with each other. 
- Pipe is much faster than a queue, this is because a Queue() is built on top of Pipe() [2]
